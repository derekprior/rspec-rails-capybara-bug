A minimal reproduction of:
https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails/issues/360

To Repro:
1. Clone
2. bundle install
3. bundle exec rspec

Result:
2 Specs, 1 Pass, 1 Fail (`visit` undefined)

Cause:
It seems the capybara-screenshot gem in the gemfile causes
the issue. Removing this gem from the gemfile causes both specs
to pass.
